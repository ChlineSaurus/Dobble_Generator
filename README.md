# Dobble_Generator
The game Dobble is a card game with very simple rules. There are cards with several symbols on them. Each card has exactly one symbol in common with every other card. The first player to find this duplicate symbol wins the card. This is played until there are no more cards. The player with the most cards wins the game.

As this game is very simple in the original version with only 8 symbols on each card, I wanted to make a slightly more difficult version of the game with 14 symbols per card. Since the game uses a mathematical principle so that each card has exactly one symbol in common with every other card, I decided to write a python script to assemble the cards. It also exports the symbols directly into the PowerPoint format that is needed to print the game on meinspiel.de.

The code is not perfect, as I wrote it shortly after my first semester in computer science, but I am very satisfied with my game, which I was able to create thanks to this code.
